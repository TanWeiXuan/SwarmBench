# SwarmBench

SwarmBench is a deterministic, open-source benchmark and Kaggle-style competition for multi-agent swarm control. Two Python controllers command opposing teams of 20 holonomic drones through a randomized 100 m × 60 m arena. The authoritative simulator is headless; replays and rendering are separate.

Each team has ten FAST drones worth 1 point and ten SLOW drones worth 5 points. A drone scores by reaching the goal on the opposite boundary. Enemy drones intercept one-for-one within 0.75 m, obstacles destroy drones on contact, and the higher score after 90 simulation seconds wins.

| Type | Max speed | Max acceleration | Max jerk | Value |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| FAST | 5.0 m/s | 4.0 m/s² | 16.0 m/s³ | 1 |
| SLOW | 2.5 m/s | 2.0 m/s² | 8.0 m/s³ | 5 |

## Quick start

SwarmBench targets Python 3.12.

```bash
python -m pip install -e ".[dev,competition,render]"
python -m pytest
python -m swarmbench arena --seed 42 --render arena.png
python -m swarmbench match --controller-a rush --controller-b assignment --seed 42 --replay match.json --render match.mp4
python -m swarmbench render match.json --output match.gif
```

Baseline names are `rush`, `defend`, `greedy_value`, `assignment`, and `potential_field`. MP4 rendering uses ffmpeg when available and falls back to GIF.

## Write a controller

A controller is one class with two methods:

```python
from swarmbench import BaseSwarmController, DroneStatus


class SwarmController(BaseSwarmController):
    def initialize(self, game_info):
        self.goal = game_info.target_goal

    def step(self, state):
        direction = 1.0 if self.goal.center[0] > 50.0 else -1.0
        return {
            drone.id: (4.0 * direction, 0.0)
            for drone in state.own_drones
            if drone.status is DroneStatus.ACTIVE
        }
```

The object persists for one match, so assignments, caches, recurrent state, and loaded models may live on `self`. `step()` receives immutable perfect-information snapshots and returns `{drone_id: (ax, ay)}` in SI units. See [Controller API](docs/CONTROLLER_API.md) for command retention, validation, and deadlines.

## Submit a controller

Open a PR containing exactly one file at `submissions/<github-login>/<controller-name>.py`. Validation checks structure, imports/API, an empty-arena run, timing, and deterministic side-swapped calibration. A trusted reporter maintains one sticky progress comment and enables squash auto-merge after the required `Submission Gate` passes. See the [submission guide](docs/SUBMISSION_GUIDE.md).

## Reproducibility and security

Scenario identity is `(generator_version, seed)`. Match replays also record engine/API versions, controller hashes, accepted command changes, events, and final results. SwarmBench seeds Python, NumPy, and PyTorch CPU RNGs where applicable; arbitrary native third-party behavior can never be guaranteed bit-for-bit, but the engine itself is deterministic.

Running third-party controllers locally executes untrusted Python. Official CI uses persistent Docker workers with no network, a read-only filesystem, bounded scratch space, CPU/memory/process limits, and no write credentials or secrets. Static source checks are only usability checks, not a security boundary. Read [SECURITY.md](docs/SECURITY.md) before running community code locally.

Detailed rules are in [GAME_SPEC.md](docs/GAME_SPEC.md); tournament design and manual commands are in [TOURNAMENTS.md](docs/TOURNAMENTS.md). SwarmBench is available under the [MIT License](LICENSE).
